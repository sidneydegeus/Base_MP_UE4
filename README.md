<h1>Base_MP_UE4</h1>
Basic multiplayer (with third person characters) in Unreal Engine 4 (1.22.3) with a main menu that allows hosting and joining.
This project is meant to learn the engine and the editor in  it's entirety. Primarily using C++ for the vast majority of the code/mechanics.

Contains various interactions such as:
- picking up weapons
- entering/exiting vehicles
- targetting (lock on)

Other stuff is related to animations and movement and so on such as replicated death, dodges, sidesteps, weapon attacks and so on.
