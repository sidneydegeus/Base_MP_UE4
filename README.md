Work in progress -

<h1>Base_MP_UE4</h1>
Basic multiplayer (with third person characters) in UE4 with a main menu that allows hosting and joining.

I've sort of done this already before but the idea is that this is a very clean project to be used as a template so that it's easy to look back at.

Might get updated in terms of branches to have a template for various ways (e.g. using regular connect by ip or using steam as a server)
